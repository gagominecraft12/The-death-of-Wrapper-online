<h1 id="wrapper-offline-faq">Reason why i shut it down</h1>
<p>The first reason why i shut it down was the insane amount of people
1. Wrapper: Online was not meant to be this big. One Free tier AWS VM was not enough for the mass amount of people
2. Raids: Yeah, this is another reason why. They where extremly annoying and kept spamming GoAnimate porn.
3. The GoAnimate community (the biggest reason): Ok, Everytime the site went down everyone went like it was the end of the world or something.
They kept wining and complaining that WrApEr OnLiNe GOT PaTcheD!!11111111 And also, the recent situation of the raiding has got to be the WORST state the ga community has been in.
No one can even handle trolls and they take them seriously.
Everyone was screaming IS WRAPPER ONLINE PATCHED 
4. Lack of accounts/importing: This was another reason why i closed it. Legacy Video Maker Clones just were not made to be hosted on a website.</p>
